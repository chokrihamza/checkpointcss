        <h1> Hey I am Bill Gates</h1>
        <p class="biog">Born in 1955 in Seattle, Gates had a supportive family
          “who encouraged his interest in computers at an early age”,
          reads the biography on his blog, Gates Notes.

          He enrolled in Harvard University by 1973, but
          dropped out to start software company Microsoft with his
          friend, Paul Allen, in 1975.

          The pair had a vision of “a computer on every desktop
          and in every home”. It must have seemed improbable to people
          in those years. But today it is a reality in many parts of the
          world as technology is integrated more and more into peoples’
          everyday lives.</p>

            The foundation does work across the world, including in Africa.

            Nearly a billion people worldwide are affected by severe hunger and poverty,
            it says; it has identified agricultural development to help farmers who rely
            on tiny plots of land for their food and some income.

            “Our goal is to help these farming families produce more food
            and increase their income, while preserving the land for future generations,”
            the foundation explains.</div>
